# DomoticShutter
Arduino-Controlled Shutter with programmable tasks and LED display device.

## Requirements
* User can control the shutters manually via buttons.
* Arduino can interface with shutter via wired or/and RF (the best solution).
* Arduino can program tasks like move shutters at a previously set time.
* Interrupts for buttons must be used in order to minimize the consumption of the system.
* Due physical limitations an Arduino Mini Pro is used.
* Four buttons will be used in order to accomplish with HCI compliants (Left/Up/Down/Right).
