# Roller Shutter Control Panel
- This project is an embedded system control panel to manage custom shutters, lights and some other minor functions.

The Roller Shutter Control Panel is released as “open hardware” involving 3d printed parts, electronic devices and a PCB board with an ATMega328P microcontroller and ESP8266 Wifi Module.

# Motivation
This personal project was initially developed due the need to close my own motor-powered shutters at a certain time of the day, specially at dawn, as the sun points directly to my head (and even more annoying to my eyes) when I'm still sleeping. I thought I was able to create a solution to this so I wanted to expand the functionality and add some domotic features.

After some time this became a Bachelor's Degree Final Project as part as my Degree in Electronic Systems Engineering.

But the most important aspect of this, it's the experience acquired in the learning process by doing this.

Being an open project where anyone can be part of the design team; anyone can bring knowledge, comments and ideas for developing other improved Arduino compatible board or mechanical changes, improvements and any kind of contribution. The cost has been optimised as much as possible to accomodate any budget, reuse components that I already have and pursue the real open hardware’s spirit.
